<h3>Skynet is here, now with features</h3>

<img src="german.jpg"> <img src="american.jpg"><br><br>

The first feature is to watch what ever the fuck you want. This page 
will tell you how to setup FoxyProxy so you are able to do that. The 
server is located in the United States so anything that is restricted by 
country can use FoxyProxy also. In the future we want more servers in 
more countries so everybody can do what ever the fuck they want. This is 
only one server on a cable connection right now, so you might have to 
pause the video to wait for it to load. <br><br>

The first thing you need is the FireFox browser. <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">
Here is the link.</a> FoxyProxy is a plugin for FireFox, but you can 
also use axecution with anything that accepts a SOCKS proxy (more on 
that later if you don't know what I'm writing about).<br><br>

You will need to download and run <a href="http://haanstra.eu/putty/download/putty.exe">PuTTY Tray</a>
(<a href="http://haanstra.eu/putty/">the 
webpage is here if you want more information)</a>. Read on to see what 
to do with PuTTY.<br><br>

The next thing is to install the FoxyProxy plugin and configure it. 
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2464">You can 
get it here.</a>

<h4>Now to configure it...</h4>

First we will configure PuTTY and then FireFox/FoxyProxy.<br><br>

<table border=0>
<tr><td>
<img src="putty-host.jpg" align="left">
In the main screen for PuTTY Tray type axecution.net for the Host Name. 
Port 
should be 22, but don't click open yet. You need to configure an SSH 
tunnel first (this will let you use the proxy). Type a name under saved 
sessions and click save if you want to use it later on.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<img src="putty-config.jpg" align="left">
First go to the Connection category and bring up SSH then click on 
"Tunnels" (secret tunnel lopl). In "Source port" enter 9999 and click 
"Dynamic" under destination, then click add. You can then go back to the 
session category and click "Open" in the lower right.<br><br>
Type in the user name and password on the flyer (sorry, but we have 
limited bandwidth right now so not everybody can use axecution!). If you 
can find another system to connect to with SSH though these same 
instructions will work. When you type in your password it will look like 
nothing is being typed in, so just keep typing it. In order for this to 
work with YouTube the server would needs to be in a different country.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<img src="fp-icon.jpg" align="left">
Now lets move on to FoxyProxy. Once it is installed and FireFox has been 
reset there will be a fox icon in the lower right hand corner, click on 
that to bring up the FoxyProxy options.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<img src="add-new.jpg" align="left">
Click the add new button to add axecution to your proxy list.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<img src="manual-config.jpg" align="left">
Under Proxy Details set the Host or IP Address to "localhost" and the 
port to 9999, and check the "SOCKS proxy?" option.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<img src="add-new-pattern.jpg" align="left">
Click over to URL Patterns and click on Add New Pattern. Name the new 
pattern "YouTube." This pattern will make it so you will only use the 
proxy while going to youtube. The URL pattern is "*.youtube.com/*" 
Make sure the enable check mark is checked. Click OK.
</td></tr>

</table>

You might need to restart FireFox for this to work, but you should now 
be able to watch anything that's on YouTube now :D<br><br>

If you're still wanting more you can install YouTube Enhancer. It lets 
you download the videos as well as change the size of the videos. 
Probably other stuff too. You will need to install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">
Greasemonkey</a> first, then <a href="https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/33042">
YouTube Enhancer</a>. When you download video files with YouTube 
Enhancer you can use <a href="http://winff.org/html_new/">WinFF</a> to 
convert the video files into MP3s so you can listen to them with your 
MP3 players.
